# Fluent Store - Privacy Policy 

## How We Collect and Use Information 

### Telemetry 
Fluent Store may collect anonymous, aggregate telemetry. You can view Fluent Store's open source repository on GitHub to see all the areas where the app tracks telemetry. Examples may include which apps are being downloaded or installed, and any errors that may cause crashes or other issues. This information is not personally identifiable. Telemetry is used to help guide the development of Fluent Store by analyzing which features are being used or not used. This data is not used for marketing or sales. This data is not sent to any third party. 

If you are using a version of Fluent Store with telemetry, you may opt-out by going into Fluent Store's settings and turning off the Telemetry toggle. 


### Fluent Store Social

Fluent Store Social allows you to create, sync, and share lists of apps ("Collections") from supported app stores ("Sources"). The Fluent Store web API is built using Google's Firebase services, and you may read [Firebase's privacy policy here](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy). The following information may be collected and stored:
- Any Collections you create, including the Collection's name, description, short indicator, and a link to the image. Note that a copy of the image is *not* stored.
- Your non-identifiable ID (an ID given to us when you sign in with your email).
- Your customizable username, if you provide one.

None of the data listed above is given to third parties or used for advertising or tracking purposes. If you do not want these data uploaded and stored on our server, please do not use Fluent Store Social.
